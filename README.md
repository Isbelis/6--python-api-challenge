# 6--python-api-challenge

This activity was broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy, according to the starter code will guide you through the process of using your Python coding skills to develop a solution to address the required functionalities.
The following did: 
## part 1. WeatherPy 
1. Created Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude.
2. Used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the started code.
3. Created a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Temperature.
4. Created a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Humidity.
5. Created a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Cloudiness.
6. Created a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Wind Speed. 

### Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship 
Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude. 

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude.

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude. 

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude.

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude. 

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude.

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude. 

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude.
  
## Part 2. VacationPy
1. Created a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame.
2. Narrowed down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition.
3. Used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates for each city in the hotel_df DataFrame.
4. Added the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.

### Note: The maps were saved, but I added to folder in png. file
